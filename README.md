## Description

This application is built using `Node.js` and `npm inquirer pkg` that takes in information(from the terminal) about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. This app is written entirely in Javascript, using Bootstrap and template literals that will render and create a sophisticated Team Profile page in a html format.
